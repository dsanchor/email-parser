# What We're Focused On

Building Azure Logic App → Cosmos DB + Blob Storage email processing pipeline with a containerized Python web app on Azure Container Apps. Apple-inspired design. Managed identities throughout.

## Where We Left Off
Full initial build complete. All files created, 30 tests passing, committed. Kane's quality review addressed (XSS fix + error handling).

## What's Deployed
- docs/architecture.md, README.md
- infrastructure/deploy.sh (all AZ CLI commands)
- logic-app/workflow.json + connections.json
- web-app/ (FastAPI + Apple UI + Dockerfile)
- tests/ (30 tests, infra validation script)

## Next Steps
- Run `bash infrastructure/deploy.sh` to provision Azure resources
- Configure Office 365 OAuth connection in Azure Portal
- Build & push Docker image to ACR
- Deploy container to Azure Container Apps
